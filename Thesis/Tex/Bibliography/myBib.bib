We give an algorithmic characterization of such mechanisms and show that they are provably better than mechanisms without verification, i.e., those previously considered in the literature. These results are obtained for a number of optimization problems motivated by the Internet and recently studied in the algorithmic mechanism design literature. The characterization can be regarded as an alternative approach to existing techniques to design truthful mechanisms. The construction of such mechanisms reduces to the construction of an algorithm satisfying certain "monotonicity" conditions which, for the case of verification, are much less stringent. In other words, verification makes the construction easier and the algorithm more efficient (both computationally and in terms of approximability). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The facility location problem has emerged as the benchmark problem in the study of the trade-off between incentive compatibility without transfers and approximation guarantee, a research area also known as approximate mechanism design without money. One limitation of the vast literature on the subject is the assumption that agents and facilities have to be located on the same physical space. We here initiate the study of constrained heterogeneous facility location problems, wherein selfish agents can either like or dislike the facility and facilities can be located on a given feasible region of the Euclidean plane. In our study, agents are assumed to be located on a real segment, and their location together with their preferences towards the facilities can be part of their private type. Our main result is a characterization of the feasible regions for which the optimum is incentive-compatible in the settings wherein agents can only lie about their preferences or about their locations. The stark contrast between the two findings is that in the former case any feasible region can be coupled with incentive compatibility, whilst in the second, this is only possible for feasible regions where the optimum is constant.},

Interestingly, the characterization deviates from the one given by Schummer and Vohra (2004) for the continuous case. In particular, it is shown that an SP mechanism on a cycle is close to dictatorial, but all agents can affect the outcome, in contrast to the continuous case. Our characterization is also used to derive a lower bound on the approximation ratio with respect to the social cost that can be achieved by an SP mechanism on certain graphs. Finally, we show how the representation of such graphs as subsets of the binary cube reveals common properties of SP mechanisms and enables one to extend the lower bound to related domains.},

A set of strategic agents have different ideal locations for the facility; the cost of an agent is the distance between its ideal location and the facility. A mechanism maps the locations reported by the agents to the location of the facility. We wish to design mechanisms that are strategyproof (SP) in the sense that agents can never benefit by lying and, at the same time, provide a small approximation ratio with respect to the minimax measure. We design a novel "hybrid" strategyproof randomized mechanism that provides a tight approximation ratio of 3/2 when the network is a circle (known as a ring in the case of computer networks). Furthermore, we show that no randomized SP mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than 2 — o(1), even when the network is a tree, thereby matching a trivial upper bound of two.},

abstract = {The study of the facility location problem in the presence of self-interested agents has recently emerged as the benchmark problem in the research on mechanism design without money. In the setting studied in the literature so far, agents are single-parameter in that their type is a single number encoding their position on a real line. We here initiate a more realistic model for several real-life scenarios. Specifically, we propose and analyze heterogeneous facility location without money, a novel model wherein: (i) we have multiple heterogeneous (i.e., serving different purposes) facilities, (ii) agents' locations are disclosed to the mechanism and (iii) agents bid for the set of facilities they are interested in (as opposed to bidding for their position on the network).We study the heterogeneous facility location problem under two different objective functions, namely: social cost (i.e., sum of all agents' costs) and maximum cost. For either objective function, we study the approximation ratio of both deterministic and randomized truthful algorithms under the simplifying assumption that the underlying network topology is a line. For the social cost objective function, we devise an ( n - 1 ) -approximate deterministic truthful mechanism and prove a constant approximation lower bound. Furthermore, we devise an optimal and truthful (in expectation) randomized algorithm. As regards the maximum cost objective function, we propose a 3-approximate deterministic strategyproof algorithm, and prove a 3/2 approximation lower bound for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose a 3/2-approximate randomized strategyproof algorithm and prove a 4/3 approximation lower bound for randomized strategyproof algorithms.},

@article{Feigenbaum2020,
abstract = {We consider the design of mechanisms for locating facilities on an interval. There are multiple agents on the interval, each receiving a utility determined by their distances to the facilities. The objectives considered are maximization of social welfare (sum of utilities) and egalitarian welfare (minimum utility). Agents can misreport their locations, and so we require the mechanisms to be strategyproof—no agent should be able to benefit from misreporting; subject to strategyproofness, we attempt to design mechanisms that are approximately optimal (have small worst-case approximation ratios). The novelty of our work is the consideration of models in which single-dipped and single-peaked preferences exist simultaneously. We consider two models. In the first model, there is a single facility, and agents may disagree about its nature: some agents prefer to be near the facility, while others prefer to be far from it. In the second model, there are two facilities: a desirable facility that all agents want near, and an undesirable facility that all agents want far. We design a variety of approximately optimal strategyproof mechanisms for both models, and prove several lower bounds as well. For the social welfare objective, we provide best-possible deterministic strategyproof mechanisms in the first model and the second model. We then provide improved randomized strategyproof mechanisms for each model, as well as a non-tight lower bound on the worst-case approximation ratio attainable by such mechanisms for the first model. For the egalitarian welfare objective, we provide a lower bound on randomized strategyproof mechanisms for the first model, as well as an optimal (non-approximate) strategyproof mechanism for the second model. All of our mechanisms are also group strategyproof: no coalition of agents can unanimously benefit from misreporting.},

@article{Caragiannis2012,
abstract = {Algorithmic mechanism design is concerned with designing algorithms for settings where inputs are controlled by selfish agents, and the center needs to motivate the agents to report their true values. In this paper, we study scenarios where the center may be able to verify whether the agents report their preferences (types) truthfully. We first consider the standard model of mechanism design with partial verification, where the set of types that an agent can report is a function of his true type. We explore inherent limitations of this model; in particular, we show that the famous Gibbard - Satterthwaite impossibility result holds even if a manipulator can only lie by swapping two adjacent alternatives in his vote. Motivated by these negative results, we then introduce a richer model of verification, which we term mechanism design with probabilistic verification. In our model, an agent may report any type, but will be caught with some probability that may depend on his true type, the reported type, or both; if an agent is caught lying, he will not get his payment and may be fined. We characterize the class of social choice functions that can be truthfully implemented in this model. We then proceed to study the complexity of finding an optimal individually rational implementation, i.e., one that minimizes the center's expected payment while guaranteeing non-negative utility to the agent, both for truthful and for non-truthful implementation. Our hardness result for non-truthful implementation answers an open question recently posed by Auletta et al. [2011]. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

Departing from previous work, we consider any possible (finite or infinite) domain and general symmetric verification. We identify a natural property, namely, that the correspondence graph of a symmetric verification M is strongly connected by finite paths along which the preferences are consistent with the preferences at the endpoints, and prove that this property is sufficient for the equivalence of truthfulness and M-truthfulness. In fact, defining appropriate versions of this property, we obtain this result for deterministic and randomized mechanisms with and without money. Moreover, we show that a slightly relaxed version of this property is also necessary for the equivalence of truthfulness and M-truthfulness. Our conditions provide a generic and convenient way of checking whether truthful implementation can take advantage of any symmetric verification scheme in any (finite or infinite) domain. Since the simplest symmetric verification is the local verification, specific cases of our result are closely related, in the case without money, to the research about the equivalence of local truthfulness and global truthfulness. To complete the picture, we consider asymmetric verification and prove that a social choice function is M-truthfully implementable by some asymmetric verification M if and only if f does not admit a cycle of profitable deviations.},

Having a good allocation in mind, a mechanism with verification selects few critical agents and detects, using a verification oracle, whether they have reported truthfully. If yes, the mechanism produces the desired allocation. Otherwise, the mechanism ignores any misreports and proceeds recursively with the remaining agents. We obtain randomized truthful (or almost truthful) mechanisms without money that verify only O(ln m/eps) agents, where m is the number of outcomes, independently of the total number of agents, and are (1-eps)-approximate for the social welfare. We also show that any truthful mechanism with a constant approximation ratio needs to verify Omega(log m) agents. A remarkable property of our mechanisms is immunity (to agent misreports), namely that their outcome depends only on the reports of the truthful agents.},

 abstract = {We study the question of whether local incentive constraints are sufficient to imply full incentive compatibility in a variety of mechanism design settings, allowing for probabilistic mechanisms. We give a unified approach that covers both continuous and discrete type spaces. On many common preference domains—including any convex domain of cardinal or ordinal preferences, single-peaked ordinal preferences, and successive single-crossing ordinal preferences—local incentive compatibility (suitably defined) implies full incentive compatibility. On domains of cardinal preferences that satisfy a strong nonconvexity condition, local incentive compatibility is not sufficient. Our sufficiency results hold for dominant-strategy and Bayesian Nash solution concepts, and allow for some interdependence in preferences.},

abstract = {We study the question of which social choice functions from an abstract type space to a set of outcomes are truthful, i.e., implementable by truthful mechanisms, when utilities are quasi-linear. For convex domains, our main theorem characterizes truthful social choice functions as those satisfying two properties: local weak monotonicity and vortex-freeness. The first of these constrains the function values at any two sufficiently proximal points, while the second asserts that its line integrals around sufficiently small triangular loops must vanish.The characterization implies a local-to-global principle that allows one to deduce truthfulness of a function from its behavior on arbitrarily small neighborhoods of each point. Other consequences include a simple alternate derivation of the Saks-Yu Theorem that weak monotonicity characterizes truthfulness of functions having a convex domain and finite range, and a sufficient condition for constructing truthful functions by "stitching together" truthful subfunctions on different subsets of the domain. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Departing from previous work, that mostly considers the identity cost function, we are interested in mechanisms without payments that are (group) strategyproof for any given cost function, and achieve a good approximation ratio for the social cost and/or the maximum cost of the agents.We present a randomized mechanism, called Equal Cost, which is group strategyproof and achieves a bounded approximation ratio for all k and n, for any given concave cost function. The approximation ratio is at most 2 for Max Cost and at most n for Social Cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mechanism with a bounded approximation ratio for instances with k ≥ 3 facilities and any number of agents. Our result implies an interesting separation between deterministic mechanisms, whose approximation ratio for Max Cost jumps from 2 to unbounded when $k$ increases from 2 to 3, and randomized mechanisms, whose approximation ratio remains at most 2 for all k. On the negative side, we exclude the possibility of a mechanism with the properties of Equal Cost for strictly convex cost functions. We also present a randomized mechanism, called Pick the Loser, which applies to instances with k facilities and only n = k+1 agents. For any given concave cost function, Pick the Loser is strongly group strategy proof and achieves an approximation ratio of 2 for Social Cost.},

we consider a setting where agents have Euclidean preferences, defined by their
ideal points, for a facility to be located in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For the minisum
objective and an odd number of agents, we show that the coordinate-wise median
mechanism (CM) has a worst-case approximation ratio (AR) of
$\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{n^2+1}}{n+1}$. Further, we show that CM has the lowest AR
for this objective in the class of deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof
mechanisms. For the $p-norm$ social welfare objective, we find that the AR for
CM is bounded above by $2^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{2}{p}}$ for $p\geq 2$. Since any
deterministic strategyproof mechanism must have AR at least $2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}$
(\citet{feigenbaum_approximately_2017}), our upper bound suggests that the CM
is (at worst) very nearly optimal. We conjecture that the approximation ratio
of coordinate-wise median is actually equal to the lower bound
$2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}$ (as is the case for $p=2$ and $p=\infty$) for any $p\geq

A solution assigns a compromise point to these n points, and the individual utilities for this compromise point are equal to the negatives of the Euclidean distances to the individual positions. For m = 2 and n odd, it is shown that a solution is Pareto optimal, anonymous, and strategy-proof if, and only if, it is obtained by taking the coordinatewise median with respect to a pair of orthogonal axes. Further, for all other situations with m≥2, such a solution does not exist.

@article{Moulin1980,
abstract = {This paper investigates one of the possible weakening of the (too demanding) assumptions of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem. Namely we deal with a class of voting schemes where at the same time the domain of possible preference preordering of any agent is limited to single-peaked preferences, and the message that this agent sends to the central authority is simply its ‘peak' — his best preferred alternative. In this context we have shown that strategic considerations justify the central role given to the Condorcet procedure which amounts to elect the ‘median' peak: namely all strategy-proof anonymous and efficient voting schemes can be derived from the Condorcet procedure by simply adding some fixed ballots to the agent's ballots (with the only restriction that the number of fixed ballots is strictly less than the number of agents). Therefore, as long as the alternatives can be ordered along the real line with the preferences of the agents being single-peaked, it makes little sense to object against the Condorcet procedure, or one of its variants that we display in our characterization theorem. An obvious topic for further research would be to investigate reasonable restrictions of the domain of admissible preferences such that a characterization of strategy-proof voting schemes can be found. The single-peaked context is obviously the simplest one, allowing very complete characterizations. When we go on on to the two-dimensional state of alternatives the concept of single peakedness itself is not directly extended and a generalization of our one-dimensional results seems to us to be a difficult but motivating goal.},

A mechanism maps the agents' locations to a set of facilities. The agents seek to minimize their connection cost, namely the distance of their true location to the nearest facility, and may even misreport their location. We are interested in mechanisms that are strategyproof, i.e., ensure that no agent can benefit from misreporting her location, do not resort to monetary transfers, and approximate the optimal social cost. We focus on the closely related problems of k-Facility Location and Facility Location with a uniform facility opening cost, instead of a bound of k on the number of facilities. In the former, the social cost is the agents' total connection cost, while in the latter, the social cost is the sum of the total connection cost and the total facility opening cost. We mostly study mechanisms that are winner-imposing, in the sense that they allocate facilities to agents and require that each agent allocated a facility should connect to it. We prove that the winner-imposing version of the Proportional mechanism, proposed by Lu et al. (2010) [18], is stategyproof for the k-Facility Location game, and achieves an approximation ratio of at most 4k, for any k&gt;=1. For the Facility Location game, we show that the winner-imposing version of the randomized online algorithm of Meyerson (2001) [21], which has an approximation ratio of 8, is strategyproof. Furthermore, we present a deterministic non-imposing group strategyproof O(logn)-approximate mechanism for the Facility Location game on the line. We also consider oblivious winner-imposing mechanisms for location games on continuous metric spaces, and show that they are strategyproof iff they are locally strategyproof, i.e. no agent can benefit by reporting a location arbitrarily close to her true location.},

optimal up to an additive factor of the order of magnitude of one over the
square root of the number of agents and involves no utility transfers. Underlying our mechanism is a lottery between two auxiliary mechanisms: with
high probability we actuate a mechanism that reduces players' influence on the
choice of the social alternative, while choosing the optimal outcome with high
probability. This is where the recent notion of differential privacy is
employed. With the complementary probability we actuate a mechanism that is
typically far from optimal but is incentive compatible. The joint mechanism

The cost of an agent is measured by the distance from its location to the nearest facility. We study the approximation ratio of social welfare for strategy-proof mechanisms, where no agent can benefit by misreporting its location. In this paper, we use the total cost of agents as social welfare function. We study two extensions of the simplest version as in [9]: two facilities and multiple locations per agent. In both cases, we analyze randomized strategy-proof mechanisms, and give the first lower bound of 1.045 and 1.33, respectively. The latter lower bound is obtained by solving a related linear programming problem, and we believe that this new technique of proving lower bounds for randomized mechanisms may find applications in other problems and is of independent interest. We also improve several approximation bounds in [9], and confirm a conjecture in [9].",

abstract = {We consider the problem of locating facilities in a metric space to serve a set of selfish agents. The cost of an agent is the distance between her own location and the nearest facility. The social cost is the total cost of the agents. We are interested in designing strategy-proof mechanisms without payment that have a small approximation ratio for social cost. A mechanism is a (possibly randomized) algorithm which maps the locations reported by the agents to the locations of the facilities. A mechanism is strategy-proof if no agent can benefit from misreporting her location in any configuration. This setting was first studied by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [21]. They focused on the facility game where agents and facilities are located on the real line. Alon et al. studied the mechanisms for the facility games in a general metric space [1]. However, they focused on the games with only one facility. In this paper, we study the two-facility game in a general metric space, which extends both previous models. We first prove an $\Omega$(n) lower bound of the social cost approximation ratio for deterministic strategy-proof mechanisms. Our lower bound even holds for the line metric space. This significantly improves the previous constant lower bounds [21, 17]. Notice that there is a matching linear upper bound in the line metric space [21]. Next, we provide the first randomized strategy-proof mechanism with a constant approximation ratio of 4. Our mechanism works in general metric spaces. For randomized strategy-proof mechanisms, the previous best upper bound is O(n) which works only in the line metric space. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

@article{Balcan2015,
abstract = {The $k$-center problem is a canonical and long-studied facility location and
clustering problem with many applications in both its symmetric and asymmetric
forms. Both versions of the problem have tight approximation factors on worst
case instances. Therefore to improve on these ratios, one must go beyond the
worst case. In this work, we take this approach and provide strong positive results both
for the asymmetric and symmetric $k$-center problems under a natural input
stability (promise) condition called $\alpha$-perturbation resilience [Bilu and
Linia 2012], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any
alpha-factor perturbation to the input distances. We provide algorithms that
give strong guarantees simultaneously for stable and non-stable instances: our
algorithms always inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation
algorithms, and output the optimal solution if the input is $2$-perturbation
resilient. Furthermore, we prove our result is tight by showing symmetric
$k$-center under $(2-\epsilon)$-perturbation resilience is hard unless $NP=RP$. The impact of our results are multifaceted. This is the first tight result
for any problem under perturbation resilience. Furthermore, our results
illustrate a surprising relationship between symmetric and asymmetric
$k$-center instances under perturbation resilience. Unlike approximation ratio,
for which symmetric $k$-center is easily solved to a factor of 2 but asymmetric
$k$-center cannot be approximated to any constant factor, both symmetric and
asymmetric $k$-center can be solved optimally under resilience to
2-perturbations. Finally, our guarantees in the setting where only part of the
data satisfies perturbation resilience makes these algorithms more applicable
to real-life instances.},

@article{Ben-David2014,
abstract = {We consider the model introduced by Bilu and Linial (2010) [13], who study problems for which the optimal clustering does not change when distances are perturbed. They show that even when a problem is NP-hard, it is sometimes possible to obtain efficient algorithms for instances resilient to certain multiplicative perturbations, e.g. on the order of O(n) for max-cut clustering. Awasthi et al. (2012) [6] consider center-based objectives, and Balcan and Liang (2012) [9] analyze the k-median and min-sum objectives, giving efficient algorithms for instances resilient to certain constant multiplicative perturbations.Here, we are motivated by the question of to what extent these assumptions can be relaxed while allowing for efficient algorithms. We show there is little room to improve these results by giving NP-hardness lower bounds for both the k-median and min-sum objectives. On the other hand, we show that constant multiplicative resilience parameters can be so strong as to make the clustering problem trivial, leaving only a narrow range of resilience parameters for which clustering is interesting. We also consider a model of additive perturbations and give a correspondence between additive and multiplicative notions of stability. Our results provide a close examination of the consequences of assuming stability in data.},

@article{Balcan2011,
abstract = {Motivated by the fact that distances between data points in many real-world
clustering instances are often based on heuristic measures, Bilu and
Linial$\sim$\cite{BL} proposed analyzing objective based clustering problems under
the assumption that the optimum clustering to the objective is preserved under
small multiplicative perturbations to distances between points. The hope is
that by exploiting the structure in such instances, one can overcome worst case
hardness results. In this paper, we provide several results within this framework. For
center-based objectives, we present an algorithm that can optimally cluster
instances resilient to perturbations of factor $(1 + \sqrt{2})$, solving an
open problem of Awasthi et al.$\sim$\cite{ABS10}. For $k$-median, a center-based
objective of special interest, we additionally give algorithms for a more
relaxed assumption in which we allow the optimal solution to change in a small
$\epsilon$ fraction of the points after perturbation. We give the first bounds
known for $k$-median under this more realistic and more general assumption. We
also provide positive results for min-sum clustering which is typically a
harder objective than center-based objectives from approximability standpoint.
Our algorithms are based on new linkage criteria that may be of independent
interest. Additionally, we give sublinear-time algorithms, showing algorithms that can
return an implicit clustering from only access to a small random sample.},

@article{Awasthi2012,
abstract = {Clustering under most popular objective functions is NP-hard, even to approximate well, and so unlikely to be efficiently solvable in the worst case. Recently, Bilu and Linial (2010) [11] suggested an approach aimed at bypassing this computational barrier by using properties of instances one might hope to hold in practice. In particular, they argue that instances in practice should be stable to small perturbations in the metric space and give an efficient algorithm for clustering instances of the Max-Cut problem that are stable to perturbations of size O(n1/2). In addition, they conjecture that instances stable to as little as O(1) perturbations should be solvable in polynomial time. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for any center-based clustering objective (such as k-median, k-means, and k-center). Specifically, we show we can efficiently find the optimal clustering assuming only stability to factor-3 perturbations of the underlying metric in spaces without Steiner points, and stability to factor 2+3 perturbations for general metrics. In particular, we show for such instances that the popular Single-Linkage algorithm combined with dynamic programming will find the optimal clustering. We also present NP-hardness results under a weaker but related condition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We consider the mechanism design problem for agents with single-peaked preferences over multi-dimensional domains when multiple alternatives can be chosen. Facility location and committee selection are classic embodiments of this problem. We propose a class of percentile mechanisms, a form of generalized median mechanisms, that are strategy-proof, and derive worst-case approximation ratios for social cost and maximum load for L1 and L2 cost models. More importantly, we propose a sample-based framework for optimizing the choice of percentiles relative to any prior distribution over preferences, while maintaining strategy-proofness. Our empirical investigations, using social cost and maximum load as objectives, demonstrate the viability of this approach and the value of such optimized mechanisms vis-\`{a}-vis mechanisms derived through worst-case analysis.},

abstract = {We study the notion of stability and perturbation resilience introduced by Bilu and Linial (2010) and Awasthi, Blum, and Shef-fet (2012). A combinatorial optimization problem is $\alpha$-stable or $\alpha$-perturbation-resilient if the optimal solution does not change when we perturb all parameters of the problem by a factor of at most $\alpha$. In this paper, we give improved algorithms for stable instances of various clustering and combinatorial optimization problems. We also prove several hardness results. We first give an exact algorithm for 2-perturbation resilient instances of clustering problems with natural center-based objectives. The class of clustering problems with natural center-based objectives includes such problems as k-means, k-median, and k-center. Our result improves upon the result of Balcan and Liang (2016), who gave an algorithm for clustering 1 + √2 ≈ 2.41 perturbation-resilient instances. Our result is tight in the sense that no polynomial-time algorithm can solve (2 - ϵ)-perturbation resilient instances of k-center unless NP = RP, as was shown by Balcan, Haghtalab, and White (2016). We then give an exact algorithm for (2-2/k) -stable instances of Minimum Multiway Cut with k terminals, improving the previous result of Makarychev, Makarychev, and Vijayaraghavan (2014), who gave an algorithm for 4-stable instances. We also give an algorithm for (2-2/k + $\delta$)-weakly stable instances of Minimum Multiway Cut. Finally, we show that there are no robust polynomial-time algorithms for n1-ϵ -stable instances of Set Cover, Minimum Vertex Cover, and Min 2-Horn Deletion (unless P = NP).},

abstract = {Under the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), the European Union issues and allo- cates emission allowances (EUA) to the member states to cap the total volume of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emis- sions. Since the first years of operation, the EU ETS allo- cation procedure has undergone multiple changes in an attempt to both fix over-allocation issues and balance sur- plus as well as to protect firms from carbon leakage. This is partially done through the means of grandfathering emission permits, auctioning or benchmark-based allo- cation. In this work, we study the allocation methods applied by the EU throughout the years, and we establish a notion of fairness based on the goals that the EU aims to achieve. Aiming to reach a balance between fairness and efficiency, we collect a series of indicators that describe the economic conditions and the energy intensity of each member state, and we perform a cluster analysis to cate- gorize the countries. We then perform a regression analy- sis to examine whether our selected indicators best descri- be the free allowance allocation of the EU ETS through- out the years and observe similarities between countries in the same clusters. Finally, we provide a simple yet flexible allowance allocation optimization problem which can incorporate various fair allocation principles proposed by the literature. },
